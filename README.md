# Base Css  
This is a simple css file to deal with common css issues in every project. Intentionally super simple.  

1. adjusting p font-size based on screensize
2. adjusting h sizes based on rem
3. Remove all margins and padding from html,body,p and h elements
4. simple button styling
5. simple anchor styling
6. article > section elements centered and have variable max width with padding on smaller sizes.

Any element needing JS is kept out. Many standart elements needing customization such as nac and footer is not included.
